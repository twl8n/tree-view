Tile based method of drawing trees in HTML without resorting to JavaScript or CSS. It takes 8 specific tiles and an algorithm to keep the tree balanced.

A Perl version of the render algo is in render-tree.pl. Do something like `perl render-tree.pl > tmp.html` and
open tmp.html in your browser. Some crude data is in @data in render-tree.pl.

There is also static demo:
